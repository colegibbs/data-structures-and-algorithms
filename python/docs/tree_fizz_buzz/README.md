# Challenge Summary

Write a function called fizz_buzz_tree. This function should take a k-ary tree as an argument. The input tree will have values of only numbers. This function should return a new tree with the same structure as the input tree. The difference between the trees will be in the values. If the inputs tree value is divisible by three then the return tree will have "Fizz" as the value in the mirror node.  If the value is divisible by 5 then the mirror node will be "Buzz". if the value is divisible by three and five then the mirror node value will be "FizzBuzz". If the value is not divisible by either then turn the number into a string.
